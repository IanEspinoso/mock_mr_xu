# Fitness Tracker Data Exploration

**Description:** This project explores Fitbit fitness tracker data. There are 18 CSV files which I narrow down to 4 core CSV files containing fitness data of users such as steps, calories loss, minutes sleep, etc. The main objective is to identify trends and insights regarding user health, behavior, and smart device usage that could be useful for health tech companies to improve their product and service offerings. The whole process is divided into 4 phases with each step and results described in a markdown report.

**Tools:** RStudio and R Markdown.

**Skills:** Data importing, assaying, data cleaning (e.g.: duplicates handling, reformatting columns), data merging, descriptive statistics, aggregating and manipulating fields, data visualization, reporting.

**Outputs:** 
- Report in `.md` format containing project details, processes, descriptions, findings, charts, and summary.
