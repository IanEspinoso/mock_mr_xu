# Chicago City 311 Service Analysis

**Description:** This project analyzes 2.8 million rows of data using SQL and Excel to help a government agency (Chicago's DSS) improve service ticket resolution time by helping them understand where to focus their resources on. After exploring the data, I create a priority quadrant based on two selected metrics, plot the data against the quadrant, cross-validate the findings with data from New York City, and deep-dive to find more patterns at district level.

**Tools:** PostgreSQL, Excel, and PowerPoint.

**Skills:** Data querying, data validation, JOINs & UNION clauses, aggregation, datetime convertion, filtering, subqueries, CTEs, conditions, PivotTables, Pivot Charts, and presentation.

**Outputs:**  
- SQL scripts with in-line notes.
- Excel workbook.
- Presentation slides.
