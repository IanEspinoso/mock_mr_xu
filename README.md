# Data Analyst Portfolio - Supoj Xu

Welcome to my data analyst portfolio!

My name is Sean, an overseas Chinese born and grew up in Thailand. I am a data analyst with experience using various tools to clean, analyze, and visualize data to empower business decisions. I am proficient in SQL, Excel, Tableau, and Python/R, and have a good understanding of data analytics techniques such as data merging, storytelling with data, process documentation, reporting, dashboard building, charts & slides design, statistics, and critical thinking.

I am confident that my data analytics skills and work experience make me a well qualified candidate for data analyst role. I hope that you find my portfolio informative, and I warmly welcome any opportunity to discuss further with you to share and learn more.

Thank you so much for your time!
