# Data Analyst Portfolio - Supoj Xu

Welcome to my data analyst portfolio!

Hello, my name is Sean. I am a data analyst with experience using various tools to clean, analyze, and visualize data to empower business decisions. I am proficient in SQL, Excel, Tableau, and Python/R, and have a good understanding of data analytics techniques such as data merging, process documentation, dashboard building, charts & slides design, statistics, and storytelling with data.

In this portfolio, I have included data projects that showcase my technical skills and analytical thinking. You will find reports, slides, and dashboards I have created using various tools such as SQL, Tableau, and Excel. These projects demonstrate my ability to organize, analyze, and present data in a clear and visually appealing way, making it easy for stakeholders to understand the insights and take action.
