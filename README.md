## Projects
In this section you can find a brief overview of my listed projects.

#### Chicago City 311 Service Analysis  
For this project, I conducted a data analysis on 2.8 million rows of data with a combination of SQL and excel to identify focused areas in order to help Chicago's DSS agency improve their ticket resolution time. I defined a priority quadrant based on two selected metrics and cross-validated the findings with data from New York City. In the end, I shared relevant insights and suggestions in presentation slides. The skills showcased in this project are null handling, data validation, JOINs & UNION clauses, aggregation, filtering, subqueries, CTEs, conditions, pivot table, pivot charts, and presentation.
