### Mock Mr Xu - Airbnb Bangkok Listings and Price Analysis  

**Description:**
This project replicates and expands upon Mr. Xu’s Airbnb listings analysis, applying it to Rio de Janeiro instead of Bangkok and integrating analytical techniques from John W. Foreman’s Data Smart. The dataset was scraped directly from Airbnb and contains over 70 columns, many requiring cleaning and restructuring. Beyond descriptive statistics and dashboarding, the analysis incorporates Data Smart’s practical frameworks for applied analytics, such as clustering hosts by pricing behavior, logistic regression to explore review likelihood, and forecasting occupancy trends. The aim is to generate insights that help first-time Airbnb hosts in Rio optimize pricing strategies, listing configurations, and competitive positioning for long-term profitability.

**Tools:** Excel and Google Slides.

**Skills:** Data cleaning and preparation (handling nulls, duplicates, outliers, string parsing, categorical encoding); descriptive and inferential statistics; clustering and segmentation analysis; regression modeling and forecasting in Excel; correlation analysis; PivotTables; scenario modeling; process documentation; charts and dashboards; effective presentation design.

**Outputs:**
- Excel workbook in .xlsx format with multiple tabs: raw data, cleaned data, data dictionary, transformation logs, exploratory analysis, clustering/regression models, pivot tables, and visual dashboards.
- Presentation slides in .pdf format outlining the problem statement, objectives, dataset profile, key findings, model-based insights (e.g., revenue drivers, pricing clusters, occupancy forecasts), recommendations, and closing remarks.

**Datasets:**
listings_detailed.csv – Rio de Janeiro listings data on Airbnb as of June 2025.
Fields: 75
Rows: 20,824
