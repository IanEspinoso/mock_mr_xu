# DATA ANALYST PORTFOLIO - Supoj Xu

Welcome to my data analyst portfolio!

My name is Sean, an overseas Chinese born and grew up in Thailand. I am a data analyst with experience using various tools to clean, analyze, and visualize data to empower business decisions. I am proficient in SQL, Excel, Tableau, and Python/R, and have a good understanding of data analytics techniques such as data merging, storytelling with data, process documentation, report writing, dashboard building, visualization design, statistics, and analytical thinking.

I have 2 years of work experience in business development and market research fields across Cloud Security and Information Services industries in Singapore and China. I have obtained a bachelor's degree in the United States and I am currently completing a part-time MBA program in Bangkok.

I am confident that my data analytics skills and work experience make me a well qualified candidate for data analyst role. I hope you find my portfolio informative, and I warmly welcome any opportunity to discuss further with you to share and learn more.

Thank you so much for your time!
