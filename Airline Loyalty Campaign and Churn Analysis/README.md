# Airline Loyalty Campaign and Churn Analysis

**Description:** This project analyzes two large data tables containing data on loyalty program enrollment & cancellation details, customer information, and flight activities. The objectives are to help the airline capture the impact of their recent promotional campaign, find patterns among churn members, and recommend the next actions. After exploration and analysis, the key findings about campaign's impacts, potential problem, and churn patterns are visualized with appropriate charts, leveraging pre-attentive attributes for effective visuals. The findings and suggestions are presented though a series of story points.

**Tools:** Tableau (View, Dashboard, and Story).

**Skills:** Data connections, calculated fields, sets, groups, binning, filters, dashboard, story, and presentation.

**Outputs:** 
- Tableau workbook uploaded to `Tableau Public` which you can view and interact with the worksheets, dashboard, and story points.
