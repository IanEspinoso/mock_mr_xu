# Airline Loyalty Campaign and Churn Analysis

**Description:** For this project, I analyzed two large data tables containg data on loyalty program enrollment & cancellation details, customer information, and flight activities. My objectives were to help the airline capture the impact of their recent promotional campaign, find patterns among churn members, and recommend the next actions. After exploration and analysis, I visualized the most important findings about the impact of the campaign, the potential problem, and churn patterns with appropriate charts, leveraging pre-attentive attributes for effective visuals. In the end, I presented the findings and suggestions in a series of story points.

**Tools:** Tableau (View, Dashboard, and Story).

**Skills:** Data connections, calculated fields, sets, groups, binning, filters, dashboard, story, and presentation.

**Outputs:** 
- Tableau workbook.
- Presentation slides.
