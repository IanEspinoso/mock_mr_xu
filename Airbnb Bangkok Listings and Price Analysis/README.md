# Airbnb Bangkok Listings and Price Analysis

**Description:** This project involves cleaning and analyzing data which was scraped directly from Airbnb platform. The data contains over 70 columns and has many formatting issues to be addressed during the cleaning process. The main objective is to find any useful insights that can help first-time Airbnb hosts in Bangkok determine best pricing and listing practices to maximize their long-term revenue based on a variety of dimensions such as room type, location, number of bedrooms, minimum nights, etc.

**Tools:** Excel and PowerPoint.

**Skills:** Data cleaning (e.g.: nulls & duplicates handling, data correction, outliers detection), string extraction, XLOOKUP referencing, categorizing, descriptive statistics, correlation, PivotTables, conditional formating, process documenting, charts building, and presentation.

**Outputs:**  
- Excel workbook in `.xlsx` format with multiple tabs covering raw data, cleaned data, data dictionary, data handling documentation, pivot tables, and charts.
- Presentation slides in `.pdf` format containing problem statement, objectives, analysis questions, data overview, outliers, findings, recommodations, and remarks.
