# Project title

**Description:** This project analyzes 2.8 million rows of data using SQL and Excel. The goal was to help a public agency in Chicago improve ticket resolution time by understanding where to focus their resources on. After exploring the data, I created a priority quadrant based on two selected metrics, plotted the data against the quadrant, cross-validated the findings with data from New York City, and deep-dived to find patterns in location fields.

**Data tools:** PostgreSQL and Excel

**Skills:** Data querying, data validation, JOINs & UNION clauses, aggregation, datetime convertion, filtering, subqueries, CTEs, conditions, PivotTables, Pivot Charts, and presentation.

**Outputs:**
